# ETS2---Euro-Truck-Simulator-2---CAN-BUS-Gaming

This is code for my dashboard project. I used my custom built display to display speed and RPM, some LEDs to show
blinkers and lights and 16x2 LCD to display fuel level.

# Installing
1. Connect LEDs and LCD to your Arduino
2. Copy a pre-built DLL into your ETS2 plugins folder
3. Copy the dash_plugin.txt options file into the plugins folder
4. Adjust the COM port in the dash_plugin.txt to suit your Arduino
